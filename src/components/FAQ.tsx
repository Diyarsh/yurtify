const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is tokenized real estate?",
    answer: "Tokenized real estate divides property ownership into digital tokens on the blockchain. Each token represents a fractional share of the property, making real estate investment more accessible and liquid."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I earn money from my modules?",
    answer: "Module holders receive monthly rental income proportional to their ownership stake. Additionally, you can trade modules on our marketplace as property values appreciate."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the minimum investment?",
    answer: "You can start investing with as little as â‚¸10,000. Our modular approach means you can buy individual tokens and gradually build your portfolio."
  },
  {
    question: "Are my investments secure?",
    answer: "Yes. All properties are legally owned by regulated entities, and your tokens are secured on the Solana blockchain. We maintain full transparency with regular audits and reports."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I sell my modules anytime?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Unlike traditional real estate, our tokens are liquid. You can sell them on our marketplace 24/7 to other investors."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if a property is sold?",
    answer: "If a property is sold, the proceeds are distributed to module holders proportionally. You'll receive your share of the sale price based on your token ownership."
  },
  {
    question: "How is Yurtify different from REITs?",
    answer: "Unlike REITs that pool investments across many properties, Yurtify lets you choose specific properties. You have direct ownership tokens and transparent, real-time reporting."
  },
  {
    question: "What blockchain does Yurtify use?",
    answer: "We use Solana for its fast transactions, low fees, and robust ecosystem. This ensures efficient trading and minimal costs for our investors."
